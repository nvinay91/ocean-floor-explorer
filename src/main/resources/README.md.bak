# Project Execution Steps

## Step 1: Requirement Analysis
- For moving on the sea bed, we need to have the fixed grid in which the probe should move
- In the request, we will take 
	- Grid Data ( Grid Coordinates in which the probe should move and Obstacles present in which coordinates)
	- Position of the probe from where it needs to start
	- Command to the probe to execute (L - Left turn, R- Right turn, F - Move Front, B - Move Back)

## Step 2: Design
- Design Direction test class to check the probe's direction (It can either turn Right or turn Left)
- Design Position test class to check the probe's movement (It can either move Front or Back)
- Design Validation class to check the probe's reached any obstacle or it is going beyond the grid.

## Step 3: Implementation
- Create a controller to take the request object and pass it to Service to Integrate Direction - Position - Validation methods.
- Return the response object having the finalPosition , isObstacleFound , visited nodes
